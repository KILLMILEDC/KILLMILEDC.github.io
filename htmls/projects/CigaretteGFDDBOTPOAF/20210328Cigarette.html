        <p id="div-root-content-Content-text">The present invention (patent) describes a new cigarette gas filtering device by which the smoke released from cigarettes burned in open spaces can be efficiently filtered. As the number of smokers continues to increase, cigarette gas pollution is becoming more and more serious, and cigarette gas accounts for an increasing proportion of the pollutants in the air environment. At present, most mainstream cigarette filters can only filter mainstream smoke, and the filtering efficiency is not high. Moreover, traditional cigarette filters are mostly disposable products, which makes the resource utilization rate not very high. The present invention (patent) provides a cigarette gas filtration device that can both efficiently filter smoke and reduce resource consumption in response to the above deficiencies.</p>
        <p id="div-root-content-Content-note">This paper describes a patent entitled "Cigarette gas filtration device designed based on the principle of air flow" (hereinafter referred to as the "Invention (Patent)"). This invention (patent) (Patent No. "ZL202120621767.1") is registered and granted by the State Intellectual Property Office of the People's Republic of China in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Patent Law of the People's Republic of China, and the patent right is effective from March 28, 2021 and is valid for ten years.
