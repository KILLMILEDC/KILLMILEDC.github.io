        <p id="div-root-content-Content-text"><b>2023-07-27 V 1.1.0</b></p>
        <p id="div-root-content-Content-text">The case marker has been rewritten and is now responsive and highly accurate in real time.</p>
        <p id="div-root-content-Content-text">At the same time, a set of system-based real-time CPU and Mem usage displays have been added. This allows the software to provide more intuitive feedback on the status of the computer.</p>
        <p id="div-root-content-Content-text">The software interface and display fonts are optimized to make the use process more convenient.</p>

        <p id="div-root-content-Content-text"><b>2023-02-23 V 1.0.0</b></p>
        <p id="div-root-content-Content-text">I wanted to add a detailed planner to my work schedule, so I wrote and developed this software.</p>
        <p id="div-root-content-Content-text">Unfortunately, the software is in its early stages and does not yet have full functionality, which will be added later.</p>
        <p id="div-root-content-Content-text">At the moment, the software can do a work time loop, which means that you can count down to a certain task to be completed, which is good for people with slight procrastination (like me), and it is easy to use. "Alt+C" will start the set countdown timer, after the countdown is over a window will pop up, the window shows the timer you set, it marks the end of the time (and perhaps the completion of the work).</p>
        <p id="div-root-content-Content-text">Perhaps you want to change the time setting or end the timer during the process, it's as easy as hitting "Alt+Q" to end the timer, no window will pop up, and the countdown counter will revert to the first set time.</p>
        <p id="div-root-content-Content-text">In addition, the software also has a case marker, which is very convenient for laptop users and users who do not have a capital keyboard light. I will try to rewrite this feature in C or C++, which is closer to the underlying language.</p>
        <p id="div-root-content-Content-text">The software is currently open source using the MIT protocol.</p>
