        <p id="div-root-content-Content-text">During the process of building the site, I encountered some difficulties in writing the code, for example, writing a whole paragraph in one line makes it difficult to go through during inspection, and when the code is too long it becomes difficult to read, etc.</p>
        <p id="div-root-content-Content-text">Therefore, I have written a visual program which relies on .NET and C# to build. Through this software, it is possible to modularize the html code writing, by specifying some prescribed text input boxes and simply typing characters in the corresponding text boxes, its possible to generate html files in a specific format, which can improve certain efficiency while ensuring the readability of the files.</p>
        <p id="div-root-content-Content-text">To write with the software, you only need to create a new workbench by "File >> New". There are three categories in the "New" list (Project, Blog and Research), There are specific breakdowns within each category, and they have the same basic framework as <a href="https:killmiledc.github.io"><i>my personal website</i></a>, which you can learn more about by reading the source code of the website or reading <a href="../../../resources/Attachments/blogs/20230124Fast/ExampleFiles.zip"><i>the sample file.</i></a>Depending on the input range defined by the visualization workbench, you can freely specify basic things like titles, release dates, etc.</p>
        <p id="div-root-content-Content-text">The text input box on the right side of the workbench is used to enter the body of the text. It can be understood as a text input device where you simply enter the text that will be displayed on the page, and it can be automatically integrated into a string in html format. Based on the "Style.css" in <a href="../../../resources/Attachments/blogs/20230124Fast/ExampleFiles.zip"><i>the sample file</i></a>, the text in this text box can be categorized as "Text" and "Note" (the purpose of the categorization is Text without any prefix will be recognized as "Text", while for non-textual text such as notes or comments, simply add the prefix "&lt;NOTE&gt;", i.e. as of an "Enter" (\r\n) before any text with the prefix "&lt;NOTE&gt;" will be marked as non-text.For the "Blog" category, it has a special prefix "&lt;IMAGE&gt;", which is used to add images.</p>
        <p id="div-root-content-Content-text">After writing, just click the "Save As" (File>>Save As) button to generate an html file, and then click the "Exit" (File>>Exit) button to exit the program.</p>
