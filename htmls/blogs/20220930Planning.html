                <p>I am sure you are aware of the work I have done in the previous months. If you don't know, you can find them in the "<a href="../../projects.html">Projects</a>" and "<a href="../../researches.html">Researches</a>" pages. In the next few months, I want to try something about the direction of "development board-based programming". On the one hand, there are a lot of interesting contents in this field; on the other hand, I can consolidate and improve my courses.</p>
                <p>The following is what I may do in the next three months:</p>
                <p># Make a small device based on Arduino uno development board, and connect it with PC to reflect the working state of PC on the external screen in real time. At the same time, the device can easily control the startup and shutdown of PC.<br /># The above-mentioned device inevitably needs programming, so it is necessary to write a program or software that can realize the function.<br /># It may also be necessary to design a specific size shell and some fixing structures for the device.<br /># For the sake of beauty, I will also do some beautification on the visual interface. After all, I need to watch the displayed content at any time.</p>
                <p>These are my expected plans for the next three months. If I finish them on time, you can find them on my website and Github (some or all of the codes involved may be protected by the applied works, but if you abide by the relevant agreements, you can use them for free).</p>
