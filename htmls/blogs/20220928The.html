                <p>Hello everyone!</p>
                <p>My name is Chen Zhang (Ch'en Chang) and you can call me Killmil Biratch. (If you want to know more, please <a href="../../aAndc.html">CLICK HERE</a>).</p>
                <P>First of all, welcome to my personal website! Although my initial purpose of setting up this static website is to learn about building a website (or to practice), I will also upload some content related to my current work here. I have divided the content of my personal website into three general sections: "Projects", "Blogs" and "Researches" (you can find them directly on the home page and access them). The "Projects" section is mainly used to show and explain some results and ongoing work that I have done or contributed to (depending on whether there are other participants in the project). The "Blogs" section is for posting my daily work progress or elaborating on certain issues, and I may periodically post plans for the next phase of my work (either short term for a week or long term for more than a week). The "Research" section contains original manuscripts of my published academic papers and links to journals (and possibly publisher access sites). </P>
                <p>Thanks to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> that I can build the website easily (The web censorship in my area prevents me from building pages easily, which is one reason I use Github Pages). But this also poses some problems. First and foremost, due to the terms of Github Pages, I can only upload content prepared in advance to the server, so if you have suggestions or comments about my personal website and the content therein, I won't receive them in a timely manner. This does cause some inconvenience. Therefore, if you have suggestions and comments on the above, or if you would like to learn more about what I have published, please contact me via the contact information below.</p>
                <p># My email (outlook): <a href="mailto:killmiledc@outlook.com"><b>killmiledc@outlook.com</b></a><br /># My email (gmail): <a href="mailto:killmiledc@gmail.com"><b>killmiledc@gmail.com</b></a> (Not recommended)</p>
                <p>Currently, I am pursuing my undergraduate degree. So, I may take a long time to update these pages. If you're interested in what I've written and can't wait for the follow-up, you'll just have to wait patiently for my next update, after all, energy is limited. To alleviate the lag caused by the above problem, I will regularly post some content with specific tags on the "blogs" page, and you can easily find them, as detailed in the list below.</p>
                <p># Short-term planning:&emsp;Used to show what might be done in the coming month (and possibly week).<br /># Mid-term planning:&emsp;Used to showcase possible work to be done in the coming months.<br /># Conclusion document:&emsp;Summarize the content of the previous period of work.</p>
                <p>All of the above can be easily found on the "blogs" page, and if you want, you don't even need to go to the other pages, you can access all of my projects, blogs and researches through the documents mentioned in the list above, as they (the documents) may have direct links in them.</p>
                <p>Due to the current work schedule, I have tentatively decided to lay out the content I post in chronological order. This means that all the content I publish is preceded (mostly by titles) by a timestamp, which you can use to get an idea of the order in which they were posted and how they are laid out (this is the best way I can think of to manage this content at the moment, if you have a better way, please let me know). Also, it is possible that the same project or research will be updated and iterated (just like a software upgrade). To make it easier to navigate, I will create links to both previous and later versions of the page and content, which allows you to access them easily.</p>
                <p>Finally, since my native language does not include English (or you could say that English is not the main language I use on a daily basis), some of the statements in this article may not be that easy for you to understand, so if you have questions about what I describe, you can contact me via email. Again, some of the content I post may not be available in English or your language for language reasons, which is not a good solution at this time, but I will try to translate them in the future. </p>
                <p>I hope you enjoy my personal website and please contact me if you are interested in the content I post.</p>
